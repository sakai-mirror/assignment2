This directory contains patches for running/building Assignments 2
against various versions and configurations of Sakai.

editPoints.patch - This patch removes the inline gradebook edit points 
  functionality (ASNN-736) from A2 if it will be running in any Sakai 
  version != 2.9.  This edit points functionality requires 1.2 
  version of the gradebook service.

remove-taggable-functionality-stub-false.patch.txt - This patches several
  *.java files so that the taggable signatures match those of previous
  versions of Sakai, all stubbed out methods return false so it also 
  disables OSP/taggable integration for this version. Institutions wishing
  to use the OSP integration with those versions can manually upgrade 
  their taggable versions and remove this patch.
