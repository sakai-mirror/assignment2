* Behavior changes when Gradebook tool is not present in site.  Not sure
if it's in the spec yet.
* Landing page may need design for case of no assignments.  Looks empty and
drab.

Settings Page
=============

* Top level settings page has not been implemented.
  SI-1
  Submission Notifications, Honor Pledge
    Both need implementation at the DB table, Service, and tool layer. No work
    on these yet.
  For TA's this includes notifications about various fine grained Gradebook
  category items.
  For Students this includes the ability to toggle receipt of a notification
  upon assignment submission.
  
Add/Edit Assignment Page
========================
  
* Honor pledge on add assignment page needs fixed.  (commented out)
* Add attachment on add assignment page needs fixed. (commented out)
* Fixed ASNN-200 Access should only display if there are groups in the site (currenlty
  always displays)
* Thickbox display position for Attachments helper and other helpers
* Random errors when using attachments helper, needs full regression
* Gradebook helper needs full regression.
* Entire page needs html structure adjustment, and updates to message
  bundle.
* Assignment due dates appear in calendar immediate if checked. Is this
  correct behavior?
* Require Submissions is not implemented yet. Requires addition at DB Table,
  Service and tool layer, but is staightforward.
* Need to add submission notifications at the tool level. GATech did work at the
  service layer for this.  Needs full regression.
* Preview assignment needs a full regression.  Currently broken.
* If gradebook tool is not on site, "select gradebook item" combo box and
  create new link needs to be hidden.  Work at tool level and perhaps service
  layer to automatically create Gradebook item with Assignment title.
  

Main Page / Reordering
======================

* Minor styling issues on Reordering. Is in fairly good shape.
* On Landing page, hovering over Group assignment icon should show list of
  groups in tooltip.
* Assignment bullets need accessible icons (instead of red/green circles).
* Need to add confirmation dialog for deleting assignments from main screen.
* Deleted assignment not really deleted after disappearing with DHTML
* Load Testing ASAP a) lots of users, b) Large number of assignments, 
  c) Large number of submissions

Submissions Page
================

* Assignment Details section can go away according spec.
* Regress release grades option and 'not released' text in grade column.
* 'Apply to all unassigned' feature needs implemented at the tool layer.
* Sections/Groups view filter not implemented.
* Regress Download/Upload functionality implemented by GATech.
* Submission status should have a label if no work has started on assignment.
* Minor css/style issues for sorting and paging.
* Load Testing ASAP

Feedback / Single Submission Page Instructor View
=================================================

* In general, a lot of work on this page.
* Redo resubmisssion
* Make defualt inline comments in FCK Editor Red
* Inline Grading
* Regress history and see whats implemented

Student Assignment View / Submission
====================================

* Broke because of minor issues at moment.
* Student landing redesigns need to be implemented.
* Load Testing ASAP


Gradebook Helpers
=================
* Missing audits
* Need to be compared to equivalent gradebook pages to make sure consistent
  (ie - only displays 2 decimal places, etc)

Testing Notes
=============

* What happens if an assignment is assigned to a group/section, and then later
  that group/section is deleted?
* Load Testing ASAP

Other
=====
* Implement event tracking
